 * Static facade resolving how much the viewing player understands about an aspect.

 * <p>This is the single gate every display surface passes through. {@link AspectComponents#name}
 * and {@link AspectComponents#description} consult it themselves, so a new tooltip, screen, or
 * compat integration masks undiscovered aspects without doing anything, and revealing one is an
 * explicit call to {@link AspectComponents#trueName}.
 *
 * <p>The resolver is player-scoped and therefore client-only. It is left unbound on the dedicated
 * server, where {@link #of} reports {@link AspectKnowledge#KNOWN} for everything, so server-built
 * messages and datagen keep real names.
 *
 * <p>The implementation is bound once at client init by Thaumaturge via {@link #bind(Function)};
 * addons must not call {@code bind}.
