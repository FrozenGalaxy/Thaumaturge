/**
 * Fired on the NeoForge game event bus after the workbench planner computes an
 * {@link ArcaneCraftCost} and before payment is taken. Listeners may replace the cost with
 * {@link #setCost(ArcaneCraftCost)} to make a craft cheaper, free, or more expensive, or to change
 * where it is paid from.
 *
 * <p>The event fires with the same context used to plan and to pay, so a replaced cost is honored
 * by the subsequent payment. Listeners that redirect payment to an external store are responsible
 * for draining that store themselves; for coordinated, simulate-aware payment prefer registering an
 * {@link IWorkbenchVisSource} instead.
